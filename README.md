# 👨‍💼 Employee Attendance Management System

## Project Overview
This project is an **Employee Attendance Management System** designed using **MySQL** to manage employee attendance records in an organization.  
It demonstrates the use of **relational database concepts** such as table creation, constraints, relationships, and SQL queries.

The database stores information about **employees, departments, attendance records, and leave requests** in a structured and organized manner.

---

## Objectives
- To design a relational database for employee attendance management  
- To practice core SQL concepts using MySQL  
- To implement relationships using primary and foreign keys  
- To track employee attendance and leave records using SQL queries  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Tool:** MySQL Workbench  
- **Language:** SQL

## Database Schema

### Tables Included:
- **Department** – Stores department details  
- **Employee** – Stores employee personal and job-related information  
- **Attendance** – Stores daily attendance records of employees  
- **Leave_Request** – Stores employee leave requests and their status

## How to Run the Project
1. Open **MySQL Workbench**  
2. Create a new SQL file  
3. Run the database and table creation queries  
4. Insert sample data using INSERT statements  
5. Execute SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY queries to view results  

---

## Expected Output
- Properly structured employee-related tables  
- Accurate attendance and leave records  
- Successful data retrieval using SQL queries  

---

## Conclusion
This project provides **hands-on experience** in designing and managing an employee attendance database using MySQL.
